## 🧩 Branch Structure

We follow a simple Git workflow:

- **main** — stable, production-ready code.
- **feature/<name>** — for new features.
- **fix/<name>** — for bug fixes.
- **chore/<name>** — maintenance or non-feature work.

### Creating a branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
